# Code of Conduct

The purpose of this code of conduct is to outline rules of participation for our community that enable a safe environment for learning and collaboration. All participants in activities organized by our community are required to conform to this code of conduct. These rules apply within all community spaces, including our email account, our workshops and our repositories. Although we will fail at times, we seek to treat everyone both as fairly and equally as possible.

## Our principles

- **Be kind and patient.**
- **Be welcoming:** We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability. We will not tolerate discrimination based on any of these characteristics.
- **Be respectful:** Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.
- **Be careful in the words that we choose:** We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren’t acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to: Violent threats or language directed against another person, Discriminatory jokes and language, Posting sexually explicit or violent material, Posting (or threatening to post) other people’s personally identifying information, Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms, Unwelcome sexual attention, Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior, Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.
- **Try to understand why we disagree:** Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different, and this diversity contributes to the strength of our community. 
- **Accept responsibility:** Whenever a participant has made a mistake, we expect them to take responsibility for it. If someone has been harmed or offended, it is our responsibility to listen carefully and respectfully, and do our best to right the wrong. Focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from the experience.
