# Skills for Open Agrobiodiversity Data

## Welcome!

Thank you for visiting the *Skills for Agrobiodiversity Data* project repository. Find out more about the project below.

## :seedling: What are we doing?

### Vision

We are designing a workshop on open data for agrobiodiversity researchers in Mexico. The goal is to encourage them to become data users apart from data collectors. We hope the workshop shows how a funding institution can promote open data practices.

### The problem

* Data collectors who contribute to an Agrobiodiversity Information System in Mexico are not familiar with open data, which is an obstacle for data use and reuse.

* There are not easily available resources to learn open data skills for agrobiodiversity in Spanish.


### The solution

* A workshop on open data to encourage contributors to become active users of data apart from collectors.
